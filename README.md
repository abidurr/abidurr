### Hi, I'm Abi! ðŸ‘‹

Education wise, I have a background in Physics, Astronomy, and History. I've also been coding since I was 11 years old, first with HTML. Since then I've done Arduino hardware, machine learning for Astronomy, data science, agent based modeling, database management software, among others. 

Now I focus on Web. My professional career started off as mostly frontend web and soon became mostly backend. Now I do both. My favorite technologies are Node, TypeScript and SQL.

Since my teenage years I've been describing myself as "Just a little guy lost in a big world full of things I don't understand. Trying to make the best of what I have and enjoying life as it comes." and that still holds true to this day. Life is one long journey of learning and building.
